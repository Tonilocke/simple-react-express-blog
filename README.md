# Simple REACT + Expressjs blog
This is a simple blog created with React and Parcel for the frontend, and nodejs + expressjs.
Database is sqlite3(easy to start thinkering with it).
Done for practice.
What drive me to do this project was the question "how can i navigate throught different pages without react-router?" using only React, so this was my solution.
